#LaserPulse

LaserPulse is a class for storing and handling laser pulses.
Pulses can be defined in either time or frequency domain.
Afterwards, both domains are automatically synchronized.

#####Functionalities:
 * **Automatic Fourier Transform:**
   When a pulse is modified in time domain the spectral field is
   automatically updated using fft, and vice versa.
 * **Physical Quantities:**
   Pulse duration, bandwidth, central frequency, and other properties 
   of the pulse are automatically calculated.
 * **Mathematical Operators:**
   The LaserPulse class supports arithmetic operations, convolutions
   and calculation of higher harmonics. By default the operators are
   applied in time domain, so for instance p1*p2 is a multiplication
   in time domain and a convolution in frequency domain. See the
   example files for more information.
 * **Pulse Trains:**
   A LaserPulse object can contain multiple sub-pulses, stored as 
   columns in a multidimensional arrays. Pulse parameters, like pulse duration and bandwidth, are
   calculated using the total pulse intensity, that is
   sum(abs(complexfield).^2,2) for a 2D array. This can be useful for
   storing the field components for different orthogonal
   polarizations.

#####Requirements:
   The LaserPulse class was tested on Matlab2015a, but it should work
   with Matlab version R2011a or more recent.

#####Installation:
 * Automatic Installation:
   From matlab: go to the folder where the LaserPulse is located (for
   example 'cd LaserPulseClass') and run the installer script
   'install_LaserPulse.m'.
 * Manual Installation:
   For installing the **LaserPulse** class, just include its parent
   folder in the matlab search path or, alternatively, copy the
   '@LaserPulse' folder in a folder which is in the matlab search
   path.  For using the additional utilities and example files, also
   add the 'utilities' and 'examples' folders to the matlab search
   path.  If the folder with the LaserPulse manual is not present,
   generate it using the matlab 'publish' function. See
   'install_LaserPulse.m' for an example.
